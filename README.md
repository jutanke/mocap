# mocap

Helper library to handle mocap data. At the moment, the CMU Mocap dataset as well as the Mocap data from the Human3.6M dataset are used.
If this library is helpful to you, please cite the following work:
```bibtex

   author        = {Tanke, Julian AND Zaveri, Chintan AND Gall, Juergen},
   title         = {{Intention-based Long-Term Human Motion Anticipation}},

}
```

## Install
This library requires some external tools, such as:

* __matplotlib__: for visualization. ```conda install matplotlib```
* __numba__: to speed-up performance. ```conda install numba```
* __transforms3d__: For handling translations between rotational data. ```pip install transforms3d```
* __tqdm__: for visualization. ```pip install tqdm```
* __spacepy__: Some datasets require to read the CDF file format from NASA. Install as follows (taken from [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37232008/how-read-common-data-format-cdf-in-python)).
```

## Usage

In case of Human3.6M, follow the steps [below](https://github.com/jutanke/mocap#human36m) first and make sure that you have downloaded the dataset from the official website. In case of CMU, the data will be automatically downloaded.

__Basic usage__:
```python
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# using Human3.6M
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
import mocap.datasets.h36m as H36M

all_actors = H36M.ACTORS  # ['S1', 'S5', ..., 'S11']  total number: 7
all_actions = H36M.ACTIONS  # ['walking', ..., 'sittingdown']  total number: 15

ds = H36M.H36M(actors=all_actors)  # 32-joint 3D joint positions, in [m]
seq = ds[0]  # get the first sequence, {n_frames x 96}
print('number of sequences:', len(ds))

for seq in ds:  # loop over entire dataset
    print(seq.shape)  # {n_frames x 96}

# -- with activities --
# For our research we hand-labeled 11 activities
ds = H36M.H36M_withActivities(actors=['S1'])  # We provide 11 framewise activity labels
seq, labels = ds[0]  # get the first sequence, {n_frames x 96}, {n_frames x 11}

for seq, labels in ds:  # loop over entire dataset
    print(seq.shape)  # {n_frames x 96}
    print(labels.shape)  # {n_frames x 11}

# -- fixed skeleton --
# Initially, each skeleton has different dimensions due to the actors being of different
# height and size. However, we also provide processed data where the skeletons of all 
# actors are processed such that they only utilize the skeleton of actor "S1".
ds = H36M.H36M_FixedSkeleton(actor=all_actors)
ds = H36M.H36M_FixedSkeleton_withActivities(actors=all_actors)

# Simplify skeleton:
ds = H36M.H36M_Simplified(ds)
# ds can be used like any other dataset above, it just simplifies the skeleton to 17 joints

# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# using CMU mocap data
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
import mocap.datasets.cmu as CMU

all_subjects = CMU.ALL_SUBJECTS
# different subjects have different actions:
action_for_subject_01 = CMU.GET_ACTIONS('01')

ds = CMU.CMU(['01'])
```

__Advanced iterations__:
```python
import mocap.datasets.h36m as H36M

# include the framerate for each sequence
ds = H36M.H36M(actors=['S1'], iterate_with_framerate=True)
for seq, framerate in ds:
    print(seq.shape)  # {n_frames x 96}
    print('framerate in Hz:', framerate)

# include the unique sequence key for each sequence
ds = H36M.H36M(actors=['S1'], iterate_with_keys=True)
for seq, key in ds:
    print(seq.shape)  # {n_frames x 96}
    print('key:', key)  # h36m: (actor, action, sid) || cmu: (subject, action)

# include both key and framerate per sequence:
ds = H36M.H36M(actors=['S1'],
               iterate_with_keys=True,
               iterate_with_framerate=True)
for seq, framerate, key in ds:
    print(seq.shape)  # {n_frames x 96}
    print('framerate in Hz:', framerate)
    print('key:', key)  # h36m: (actor, action, sid) || cmu: (subject, action)

# this also works with activity labels!
```

__Normalization__:
```python
import mocap.datasets.h36m as H36M
import mocap.processing.normalize as norm

ds = H36M.H36M(actors=['S1'])

seq = ds[0]

# normalize the sequence at a given frame: at that frame, the root joint
# is centered at the origin and the person faces forward in positive x-direction.
# The facing direction is defined by the left and right hip joints.
# The preceeding and following frames are rotated and translated relative to the
# normalized frame.
normalization_frame = 15
seq_norm = norm.normalize_sequence_at_frame(seq, normalization_frame,
                                            j_root=ds.j_root,
                                            j_left=ds.j_left,
                                            j_right=ds.j_right)
# if seq is a batch of sequences, the following function can be used:
#     {norm.batch_normalize_sequence_at_frame}


# global rotation and translation can be removed completely for a sequence:
seq_norm = norm.remove_rotation_and_translation(seq,
                                                j_root=ds.j_root,
                                                j_left=ds.j_left,
                                                j_right=ds.j_right)
```

__Visualization__:
```python
import mocap.datasets.h36m as H36M
from mocap.visualization.sequence import SequenceVisualizer

ds = H36M.H36M(actors=['S1'])

seq = ds[0]

vis_dir = '/dir/to/write/visualization/'

vis.plot(seq,
         seq2=None,
         parallel=False,
         plot_fn1=None, plot_fn2=None,  # defines how seq/seq2 are drawn

## Download data

### Human3.6M

For Human3.6M, we cannot directly provide a download link due to their distribution policy.
Instead, you first have to download their dataset from the official [website](http://vision.imar.ro/human3.6m/description.php).
Then, call the following script as follows to extract the data:
```bash
$ cd mocap/dataaquisition/scripts
$ python get_h36m_skeleton.py /path/to/h36m/folder/human3.6m
```

### AMASS
For "Archive of Motion Capture as Surface Shapes", please download the [preprocessed files](http://dip.is.tue.mpg.de/downloads). 

### CMU

The CMU mocap dataset is automatically downloaded once make use of it. This may take some time!
